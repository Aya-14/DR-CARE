Your heart may have to pump harder to deliver blood to the rest of your body, enlarging and thickening the muscle.\nHigh blood pressure can cause the left ventricle to enlarge, causing the heart muscle eventually to weaken. High blood pressure may also enlarge the upper chambers of your heart.\n\nHeart valve disease. Four valves in your heart keep blood flowing in the right direction. If the valves are damaged by conditions such as rheumatic fever, a heart defect, infections (infectious endocarditis), an irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation) connective tissue disorders, certain medications or radiation treatments for cancer, your heart may enlarge.\nCardiomyopathy. This disease of the heart makes it harder for your heart to pump blood throughout your body. As it progresses, your heart may enlarge to try to pump more blood.\nHigh blood pressure in the artery that connects your heart and lungs (pulmonary hypertension). Your heart may need to pump harder to move blood between your lungs and your heart. As a result, the right side of your heart may enlarge.\nFluid around your heart (pericardial effusion). Accumulation of fluid in the sac that contains your heart may cause your heart to appear enlarged on a chest X-ray.\nBlocked arteries in your heart (coronary artery disease). With this condition, fatty plaque in your heart arteries obstruct blood flow through your heart vessels, which can lead to a heart attack. When a section of heart muscle dies, your heart has to pump harder to get adequate blood to the rest of your body, causing it to enlarge.\nLow red blood cell count (anemia). Anemia is a condition in which there aren't enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your tissues. Untreated, chronic anemia can lead to a rapid or irregular heartbeat. Your heart must pump more blood to make up for the lack of oxygen in the blood.\nThyroid disorders. Both an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) and an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) can lead to heart problems, including an enlarged heart.\nExcessive iron in the body (hemochromatosis). Hemochromatosis is a disorder in which your body doesn't properly metabolize iron, causing it to build up in various organs, including your heart. This can cause an enlarged left ventricle due to weakening of the heart muscle.\nRare diseases that can affect your heart, such as amyloidosis.

Having an enlarged heart may make you more susceptible to forming blood clots in the lining of your heart. If clots enter your bloodstream, they can block blood flow to vital organs, even causing a heart attack or stroke. Clots that develop on the right side of your heart may travel to your lungs, a dangerous condition called a pulmonary embolism.\nHeart murmur. For people whose hearts are enlarged, two of the heart's four valves \u2014 the mitral and tricuspid valves \u2014 may not close properly because they become dilated, leading to a backflow of blood. This flow creates sounds called heart murmurs. Although not necessarily harmful, heart murmurs should be monitored by your doctor.\nCardiac arrest and sudden death.

Its signs and symptoms include drowsiness followed by profound lethargy and unconsciousness.\nA myxedema coma may be triggered by exposure to cold, sedatives, infection or other stress on your body. Myxedema requires immediate emergency medical treatment.\n\n\nBirth defects. Babies born to women with untreated hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's disease may have a higher risk of birth defects than do babies born to healthy mothers. Doctors have long known that these children are more prone to intellectual and developmental problems. There may be a link between hypothyroid pregnancies and birth defects, such as a cleft palate.\nA connection also exists between hypothyroid pregnancies and heart, brain and kidney problems in infants.
